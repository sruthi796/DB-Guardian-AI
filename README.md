🛡️ DB Guardian AIReal-Time Infrastructure Monitoring & Predictive Failure PreventionDB Guardian AI is a proactive system designed to monitor database health and predict system crashes before they occur. By leveraging Deep Learning (LSTM), the system identifies dangerous patterns in CPU, Memory, and Latency, alerting administrators via email before downtime happens.🚀 Key FeaturesPredictive Maintenance: Uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast CPU spikes 5-10 seconds in advance.Real-Time Dashboard: A neon-themed Streamlit UI providing live telemetry visualization.Automated Alerting: Integrated SMTP protocol to send emergency email notifications upon crash prediction.Lightweight Architecture: A "No-SQL" approach using high-speed CSV streaming to minimize disk footprint.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe project follows a Decoupled 3-Tier Architecture to ensure low-latency performance and system stability:The Heart (simulator.py): Generates synthetic system telemetry and logs data to a shared CSV bridge.The Brain (guardian_ai.py): The Deep Learning engine that processes temporal sequences and handles the alerting logic.The Eyes (dashboard.py): The presentation layer providing a web-based human interface via Streamlit.🧠 The Intelligence (LSTM Logic)Unlike traditional threshold-based alerts (e.g., alert after CPU > 90%), DB Guardian uses Temporal Pattern Recognition.Windowing: The AI analyzes the last 20 seconds of data to detect "rhythmic" anomalies.Gates: The LSTM's Forget, Input, and Output gates filter out minor noise and focus on critical failure signatures (like steady latency climbs paired with memory exhaustion).🛠️ Tech StackComponentTechnologyLanguagePython 3.12Deep LearningTensorFlow / KerasFrontend UIStreamlitData HandlingPandas / NumPyAlertingSMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)🚦 How to RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/sruthivaleti-a11y/DB-Guardian-AI.git
